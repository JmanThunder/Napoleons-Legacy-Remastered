mechanical_cotton;Mechanical Cotton Production;x
mechanical_cotton_desc;Egypt under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century had the fifth most productive cotton industry in the world, in terms of the number of spindles per capita. The industry was initially driven by machinery that relied on traditional energy sources, such as animal power, water wheels, and windmills, which were also the principal energy sources in Western Europe up until around 1870. It was under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century that steam engines were introduced to the Egyptian cotton industry.;x

industrial_bronze_production;Industrial Bronze;x
industrial_bronze_production_desc;Bronze, or bronze-like alloys and mixtures, were used for coins over a longer period.
